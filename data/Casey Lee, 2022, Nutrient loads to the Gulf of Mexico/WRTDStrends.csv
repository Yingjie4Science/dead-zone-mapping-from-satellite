# These data are released on the conditions that neither the USGS nor the United States Government may be held liable for any damages resulting from its use.
#
#SITE_ABB: A text abbreviation of the site name primarily for use within the National Water Quality Program
#SITE_QW_ID: Unique USGS station number indicating location where water-quality samples are collected (Note that opening this file in Excel may cause leading zeros to be dropped from this field unless imported into an open worksheet and changing columns A and B to text)
#SITE_FLOW_ID: Typically a unique USGS station number indicating location where streamflow data is recorded. In some instances these data are obtained from outside sources--in those cases the site number used by that entity is displayed. If no site number is available an abbreviated indicator of the collecting agency is displayed  (Note that opening this file in Excel may cause leading zeros to be dropped from this field unless imported into an open worksheet and changing columns A and B to text) 
#CONSTIT: A character abbreviation indicative of the water-quality constituent being reported. Values include NO3_NO2: nitrate plus nitrite filtered as N; TN: total nitrogen as N; TP: total phosphorus as P; SSC: suspended-sediment concentration; NH3: ammonia filtered as N; OP: orthophosphate filtered, as P; SI: silica filtered as SiO2; CHL: Filtered chloride; TDS: Total Dissolved Solids
#WY1: A numeric identifier of the water year representing the beginning of the trend period. A water year is defined as the 12-month period from October 1 for any given year through September 30 of the following year. The water year is designated by the calendar year in which it ends. This field will be represented by a single water year with the exception for trends to the Gulf of Mexico (SITE_ABB = GULF), which will be represented by the mean of 1980-1996.  For this case WY1 will be 1980-1996.
#WY2: A numeric identifier of the water year representing the end of the trend period.  A water year is defined as the 12-month period from October 1 for any given year through September 30 of the following year. The water year is designated by the calendar year in which it ends.
#MODTYPE: A character indicator of the type of model used to compute water-quality trends on annual flow-normalized loads or concentrations as indicated in Lee and others (2017). Values include WRTDS_FNG indicating flow-normalized loads computed using the WRTDS generalized flow-normalization method; and WRTDS_FNS indicating flow-normalized loads computed using the WRTDS stationary flow-normalization method
#PERC_L: Percentage change in annual, flow-normalized loads among water years
#PERC_L_L90: Lower 90-percent confidence interval of the trend in annual flow-normalized loads among water years.
#PERC_L_U90: Upper 90-percent confidence interval of the trend in annual flow-normalized loads among water years.
#PERC_C: Percentage change in annual, flow-normalized concentration among water years
#PERC_C_L90: Lower 90-percent confidence interval of the trend in annual flow-normalized concentration among water years.
#PERC_C_U90: Upper 90-percent confidence interval of the trend in annual flow-normalized concentration among water years.
