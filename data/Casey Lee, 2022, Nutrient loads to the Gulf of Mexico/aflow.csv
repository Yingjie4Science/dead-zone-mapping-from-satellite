#SITE_ABB: A text abbreviation of the site name primarily for use within the National Water Quality Program
#SITE_QW_ID: Unique USGS station number indicating location where water-quality samples are collected (Note that opening this file in Excel may cause leading zeros to be dropped from this field unless imported into an open worksheet and changing columns A and B to text)
#SITE_FLOW_ID: Typically a unique USGS station number indicating location where streamflow data is recorded. In some instances these data are obtained from outside sources--in those cases the site number used by that entity is displayed.  If no site number is available an abbreviated indicator of the collecting agency is displayed  (Note that opening this file in Excel may cause leading zeros to be dropped from this field unless imported into an open worksheet and changing columns A and B to text) 
#WY: A numeric identifier of the water year in which data were recorded.  A water year is defined as the 12-month period from October 1 for any given year through September 30 of the following year. The water year is designated by the calendar year in which it ends.
#FLOW: The volume of water transported for a given water year in acre-feet.
